I recently held a Twitter Space where I discussed how I learned GraphQL during my first few months as a developer advocate here at Apollo. I went over the strategies I used which can be really helpful regardless of what language, framework, or tool youâ€™re learning on the job. If you're interested in checking out the recording, Iâ€™ll leave a link at the end of this article.

For now, I want to focus more on what I used to learn GraphQL. So hereâ€™s a quick list of my favorite resources for learning GraphQL. This list includes courses, videos, tutorials, and more. So no matter your preferred medium for educational content, youâ€™ll find something that fits your style.

## 1. [What is GraphQL YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwLI70eP3mw)

If you donâ€™t know much about GraphQL or what problems it solves, this is a great video to start with. It covers the fundamentals of how GraphQL works and how developers benefit from using it.

## 2.  [GraphQL Odyssey Course](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/)

This is the main course I relied on when I was first learning GraphQL. This is free and it includes tons of great information and interactive coding exercises. And once you finish all 5 modules, you get a certificate!

## 3. [GraphQL Is for Everyone Workshop](https://www.moonhighway.com/live-events)

I was able to attend this workshop shortly after joining Apollo and it was amazing! This workshop is led by [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello) and I love the way she teaches. All the information is delivered in a fun and approachable style. This is a great workshop to attend especially if youâ€™re completely new to GraphQL.

## 4. [GraphQL Email Newsletter](https://graphqlworkshop.com/)

This email newsletter is also created by Eve Porcello. Itâ€™s an easy, low-stakes way to learn more about GraphQL. Iâ€™m a huge fan of Eveâ€™s teaching style and this email course is just as great as everything else she creates.

## 5. [Full Stack GraphQL Tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/)

This Full Stack GraphQL tutorial is a great way to start building with GraphQL. Iâ€™m a huge proponent of project-based learning. But it can be intimidating to start a project with a new language all on your own. So this is a great way to have a guided learning experience as you begin working with GraphQL.

## 6. [Everything I Learned in My 1st Year as a SWE: GraphQL Article](https://camiinthisthang.hashnode.dev/everything-i-learned-in-my-1st-year-as-a-swe-graphql)

I really enjoyed this article because hearing the perspective of another GraphQL newbie really resonated with me. It was nice to read about parts of [Camilaâ€™s](https://twitter.com/camiinthisthang) learning journey that mirrored my own. It also helped me to recognize areas of confusion that I, as a developer advocate and GraphQL educator, could help fill.  

## 7. [Getting Started with GraphQL Article](https://dev.to/shrutikapoor08/getting-started-with-graphql-emo)

This is an article thatâ€™s quite similar to this one. It includes an explanation of what GraphQL is and additional resources for learning. [Shruti](https://twitter.com/shrutikapoor08) is a pillar in the GraphQL community so Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something useful in that article.

## 8. [GraphQL Glossary](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/graphql-glossary/) 
I have to include this glossary because it was so helpful for me! I used it as a handy reference along with my courses and tutorials so I could easily check my understanding of unfamiliar terminology.

## Conclusion

If you have any recommendations for GraphQL learning resources, please feel free to leave them in the comments below. Like I said, these are resources that I personally used and enjoyed. Iâ€™m sure that there are so many more out there.

If youâ€™re interested in actual learning tips, you can listen to the [recording of the Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/ceeoreo_/status/1502008332923588610?s=20&t=DaI73vvdiPjKtR83WbEjbQ). I plan on doing more Spaces about GraphQL, developer advocacy, and working at Apollo. So let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks for readingðŸ’œ
